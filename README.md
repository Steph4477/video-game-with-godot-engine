## 🐵 Scenario

### 🌴 The Setting

Lost in the heart of a mysterious archipelago, **Moko**, a cheeky young monkey, awakens on a volcanic island cursed by an ancient power. The ecosystem is in turmoil — mutated beasts and massive flora roam the land, all under the influence of the dark and twisted **Obsidian Totem**.

### 🧪 The Twist

Moko possesses a rare gift: **Totemic Evolution**.
Every loot he collects — 🍌 *tribal fruits*, 🎭 *ancestral masks*, or 💠 *totemic essences* — grants him **new powers** and **transforms his appearance**.

But beware — every power has a price. Some loot may affect his behavior or abilities in unexpected ways...

### 🧭 The Quest

Help Moko:

1. 🗺️ **Explore** diverse islands: lush jungles, lava caves, sunken temples, and sky-high peaks.
2. ⚔️ **Fight** corrupted enemies like the venomous **Scormards**, ☠️ **toxic mushrooms**, and colossal **stone guardians**.
3. 🛕 **Recover sacred artifacts** to weaken the Obsidian Totem's grip.
4. 🔥 **Reach the final island** for an epic, transformative showdown.
