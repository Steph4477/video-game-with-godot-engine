# 🏝️ Pitch - *Island Evolution*

A 2D platform-adventure game developed with **Godot Engine**, where a small monkey evolves by collecting loot (abs, bonuses, etc.) and fights various enemies!

---

# 🐵 Scenario 

**Title:** *Island Evolution – Rise of the Jungle Hero*

### 🌴 Setting

Lost in the heart of a mysterious archipelago, **Moko**, a mischievous young monkey, awakens on a volcanic island cursed by an ancient force. The natural world is in chaos — mutated creatures and oversized plants roam freely, all under the control of a dark power: the **Obsidian Totem**.

### 🧪 The Twist

Moko soon discovers he has a rare gift: **Totemic Evolution**. Each loot he collects — magical abs, tribal masks, or ancient fruits — gives him new powers and transforms his appearance.
But every power has a cost. Some loots change his behavior, and he must learn to master these evolutions to survive.

### 🧭 Objective

To restore balance, Moko must:

1. **Explore** diverse zones across the islands: lush jungle, lava caves, sunken temples, sky peaks...
2. **Battle** corrupted enemies like **Scormards**, **toxic mushrooms**, and **stone guardians**.
3. **Find sacred artifacts** and place them in ancient shrines to weaken the Obsidian Totem.
4. **Reach the final island** for an epic showdown.

### 🌟 Core Themes

* Character evolution through loot (visual + gameplay changes)
* Cartoon-style humor and aesthetic
* A message about nature, personal growth, and overcoming inner challenges
